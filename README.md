# Memory Simulator in C

## Introduction
This project is a memory simulator implemented in C that aims to emulate different aspects of a computer's memory system. The simulator is divided into sub-projects that focus on distinct memory components: DRAM Simulator, DRAM with Cache, and Virtual Memory Simulator.

## Features

### DRAM Simulator
- Simulates the basic functioning of Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM).
- Models memory cells, addressing, and refresh operations.

### DRAM with Cache
- Extends the DRAM Simulator by adding a cache layer.
- Implements cache mapping strategies and replacement policies.
- Includes performance metrics to compare hit/miss ratios.

### Virtual Memory Simulator
- Simulates the concept of virtual memory.
- Implements page tables, TLBs (Translation Lookaside Buffers), and page replacement algorithms.
- Provides a visualization of memory mapping, paging, and page faults.
